# HNG TASH 3

This is HNG Task 3 - it is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Timbu Shop Design from a great designer.

## App Information
- This app was perfectly cloned from a Figma link. The link is provided below.
- It has a bottom navbar, but only the "home button" was worked on - same as in the Figma link.
- The app has basically 5 screens - a home screen: to display the products from Timbu API, and a product description screen: which shows a few images and text description about the selected item/product.
- It has a checkout screen: for when the cart is empty and when the cart is not empty.

## Setup Information 
To set up this flutter project locally,

- Clone this repository
- Get dependencies
- Run the app
- Enjoy the simple shopping app

  ## Technicalities
  The following third-party packages were added to the application during the development process:
  - HTTP:- a Dart library that simplifies making HTTP requests in Flutter applications. It allows us to interact with RESTful APIs, fetch data from servers, send data to backends, and much more.
  - cached_network_image:- is a Flutter library that allows you to cache images. Caching is a process that temporarily stores data, in this case, images, for faster access in the future. This package not only allows you to cache images but also supports placeholders and fading images while the image loads.
  - google_fonts:- a flutter package to use fonts from fonts.google.com. Supports HTTP fetching, caching, and asset bundling.
  - gap:- it empowers you to streamline the process of adding space between widgets in your Flutter applications.

 ## API Integration
 To use Timbu API:
- I logged into my Timbu API account.
- I generated my ApiKey and got my OrganizationId and ApiId as well.
- I added products to my API account
- I implemented the API into my app.
- I collaborated with a QA tester to perform test cases and test the app.
